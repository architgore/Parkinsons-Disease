# Parkinsons-Disease
I worked on a special project using a computer program called Python. The project was about finding Parkinson's Disease early. This disease makes people's bodies not work well, and it affects many people, especially in India.

I looked at a lot of information about Parkinson's Disease to understand it better. This information included things like a person's age, their medical history, and the results of tests. I made sure this information was correct and useful.

Then, I made a smart computer program that could look at all the information and find patterns. These patterns could show if someone might get Parkinson's Disease in the future. I trained the program to be really good at this by using a lot of examples.

The important part is that finding Parkinson's Disease early can help a lot. It can make the doctors help people before they get very sick. In India, where many people live, this could help around a million people every year. This means a lot of families could be happier and healthier.

But this project isn't only for India. The idea can help people all over the world. It shows how we can use computers and information to make healthcare better.

In short, my project used a computer program to find Parkinson's Disease early. This can help many people, especially in India. But the idea can help people everywhere. It's about using computers to make healthcare improved and people's lives better.
